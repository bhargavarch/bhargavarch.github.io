👋 Hi, I'm **Bhargav Achary** — Hardware Developer, Computer Architecture Specialist, and Tech Analyst.

I dissect cutting-edge technology through the lens of a systems engineer who understands both the silicon and the story behind it.

## 🔬 What I Do

**Hardware & AI Systems Engineer** specializing in:
- Computer architecture and multicore performance optimization
- AI-hardware co-design and edge inference systems
- System-level debugging, RTL analysis, and memory architectures
- Performance analysis at the hardware-software boundary

**Tech Analyst & Writer** exploring:
- AI chip wars: Apple Silicon, Qualcomm Snapdragon, Intel, AMD, NVIDIA
- Edge AI and on-device inference challenges
- Cloud infrastructure, system reliability, and deployment strategies
- The intersection of innovation, hype, and practical reality

## 💡 My Perspective

I bring a **critical yet optimistic lens** to tech analysis:
- **Deep Dives**: From NVIDIA's NVLink Fusion to Intel's Lunar Lake architecture
- **Real-World Testing**: Edge AI inference on M-series, Snapdragon X Elite, and AMD Phoenix
- **Honest Takes**: Calling out both brilliance and disappointment (yes, Apple Intelligence saga)
- **Systems Thinking**: Understanding how hardware, software, and AI co-evolve

## 📝 What You'll Find Here

**Technical Deep Dives**
Computer architecture breakdowns, AI inference optimization, memory system analysis, and processor comparisons.

**Industry Analysis**
Critical takes on AI trends, cloud outages, chip competition, and the future of computing.

**Practical Insights**
Real-world performance data, deployment strategies, and lessons from the bleeding edge of tech.

## 🌐 Why This Blog Exists

This is where hardware meets AI, where hype meets reality, and where complex systems get explained without losing the technical depth.

I write for engineers, tech enthusiasts, and anyone curious about **what's actually happening** beneath the marketing slides—from silicon design to AI deployment, from edge devices to data centers.
